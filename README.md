# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project was completed as part of a course project. It simulates a real-world scenario where TikTok's data team is developing a machine learning model to classify whether content contains *claims* or *opinions*. My role involved preparing the data for analysis and communicating initial findings to stakeholders.

## Project Scope
The goal was to:
- Inspect and organize a synthetic TikTok dataset using Python
- Perform initial data exploration and quality checks
- Summarize column data types, missing values, and statistical ranges
- Identify relevant variables and outliers
- Prepare an executive summary with actionable insights and next steps

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Jupyter Notebook workflow
- Executive-level communication
- Data storytelling

## Files Included
- `tiktok_project_lab.ipynb` — Python code and written responses
- `Course_2_PACE_strategy_document.pdf` — Strategic planning for data work
- `Executive_summary.pdf` — One-page summary of results and recommendations

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy
- Google Docs (for strategy & summary docs)

## Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned, explored, and summarized. Several variables such as `video_view_count` and `video_like_count` showed significant variance and will be focal points in the machine learning phase. Clear next steps were communicated to TikTok's technical and cross-functional stakeholders.
